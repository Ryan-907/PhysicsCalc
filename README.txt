This program is designed to solve simple physics equations I was taught in my Physics 101 class. 
It will do the following:
1. Kinimeatic Functions
    -Force: Calcualtes force, mass, or accelration depending on known variables (Done!)
    -Distance: Calculate distance, time, or acceleration depending on known variables
    -Work: Calcualtes work, force, or distance depending on known variables (Done!)
    -Kinetic Energy: Calcualtes Kinetic Energy, mass, or velocity depending on known variables
    Potential Energy: Calcualtes Potential Energy, mass, or distance depending on  known variables
    -Momentum: Calculates Momentum, mass, or velocity depending on known variables
    -Angular Momentum: Calcualtes Angular Momentum, mass, velocity, or radius depending on known variables
